## Purpose
- Centralize program data.
- Automate reporting to eliminate manual data runs.
- Support hospital leadership with timely metrics.

## Workflow Summary
- Built in Alteryx Designer.
- Filters, sorts and standardizes program data.
- Merges all branches into one clean output stream.
- Automated scheduling ensures dashboards refresh without manual intervention.

## Impact
- 90 % time savings by eliminating manual data runs.
- Streamlined reporting across diverse community programs.
